The three data files are encoded as UTF-8. You can use the following pandas script in python to load the data set:

import pandas
df = pandas.read_csv('frappe.csv', sep="\t")
meta_app = pandas.read_csv('apps.csv', sep="\t")
df = df.merge(meta_app, on='item')

Note, that we don't provide city names for privacy reasons. Also apps, that were downloaded not so many times are missing meta information.
However, the item id is a valid identification.
